Problem Statement:
How can we create an engaging, tech-driven e-learning platform that overcomes the limitations of traditional online education and caters to modern learners' needs?

Introduction:
Welcome to the Downhill project. We're setting out to build a next-gen EdTech platform that'll shake up the online learning space. Downhill aims to combine cutting-edge web technologies with innovative teaching methods to create an immersive, adaptive learning experience.
We're planning to use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) as our foundation. The goal is to develop features like interactive course content, real-time collaboration tools, and data-driven insights to help both educators and students.
